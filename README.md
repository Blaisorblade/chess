# README

Implement a chess program *just for fun*. AI is not a goal yet.

## Importing in IDEs

Use IDE-specific SBT plugins to generate IDE projects; I'm aware of such plugins
for Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.

I use sbteclipse, installed globally. I don't reference it in the build; if I
did, people not using Eclipse would have to download it.
